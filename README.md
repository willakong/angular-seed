# Seed

This is a seed project for Angular. It includes the following features:

- Angular Project generated with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0
- Firebase Authentication with Google Sign In
- Routing

This is intended to be a starting point so any projects that require the above can be started easily.

# Firebase Authentication

After creating a Firebase project from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), fill in the enviornment variables in `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts` for production.

# Angular CLI Usage

The following was automatically generated when creating the Angular project using the CLI. It contains help for using the CLI for development.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
